With a widespread industry focus on minimalist electronic products a
counteraction has long been overdue. 

One proposal is to move away from the conventional look of a manufactured product and explore a new aesthetic relationship between the latest technology and complex, seemingly chaotic, naturalistic forms. A structural ornamentation is proposed that does nothing to reduce functionality offering a new visual and tactile experience. It is a proposal that seeks to challenge today's received notions of how design and technology meet.
