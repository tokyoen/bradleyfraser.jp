3mm aluminum is laser cut, rolled and then welded to form this beautiful stool. The radius employed on the edges of the stool form a cylindrically strong shape. Although shown here as a polished prototype this recyclable material could have a hairline finish or be powder coated in a range of colors. With investment in tooling the shape of the stool could be produced more inexpensively in plastic.
